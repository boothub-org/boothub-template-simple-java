This section is for developers who want to fix bugs or change the functionality of the Simple-Java template.

TIP: Read about http://doc.boothub.org/releases/latest/#Templates[writing BootHub templates] before starting to change the Simple-Java template.

You should update these tests and add new ones according to the changes you make.
